# Nostr order relay adapter

**Status:** Engineering/security design baseline, not implemented or independently audited. **Priority:** MVP or prerequisite. **Normative:** MUST is required; SHOULD deviations need review.

## Scope and implementation contract
Use pinned nostr-tools NIP-44 and NIP-17/59 private-message conventions as appropriate. Relay is untrusted, may store/drop/reorder/correlate events. Define publish, subscribe, deduplicate, validate, retry, close and capability interface. Sign canonical event, check event IDs, timestamps, tags, kind and recipient binding; prohibit NIP-04 fallback. Public discovery reveals some metadata even if payload encrypted. Use multiple user-selected relays and show delivery uncertainty.

## Interface and error semantics
Define explicit versioned types and canonical serialization for every boundary, validation of all external inputs, typed errors (INVALID_INPUT, EXPIRED, UNAUTHORIZED, REPLAY, WRONG_CHAIN, UNAVAILABLE, INTEGRITY_FAILURE), retry/cancel/reconcile operations and no secret-bearing diagnostics. Public chain, external RPC, wallets and peer relays are independently untrusted; distinguish observed data from cryptographically verified facts. Require fail-closed handling of unsupported versions and security downgrades. Preserve keyboard/screen-reader access and translated error/help text.

## Threat model and tests
Forged relay events, deletion failure, duplicate events, relay censorship, malformed signatures, time skew, cross-relay linkage, key rotation.

Acceptance: unit and negative tests for all failure classes; fuzz parsers or financial invariants; test restart/reorg/timeout where relevant; browser mobile compatibility; signed deployment manifest; documented residual privacy risks; dependency version/license lock; independent security review before real funds.
