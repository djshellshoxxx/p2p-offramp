# Orderbook visibility and expiry

**Status:** Engineering/security design baseline, not implemented or independently audited. **Priority:** MVP or prerequisite. **Normative:** MUST is required; SHOULD deviations need review.

## Scope and implementation contract
Support public minimal-metadata offer, invite-only encrypted offer and local draft. Public listing may disclose token, amount range, timing and network metadata; UI must explain exposure. Expiry is signed and checked locally and on-chain before funding; relay deletion is best effort only. Never auto-fund from stale offer. Add sorting/filtering entirely client-side where feasible; avoid tracking search terms.

## Interface and error semantics
Define explicit versioned types and canonical serialization for every boundary, validation of all external inputs, typed errors (INVALID_INPUT, EXPIRED, UNAUTHORIZED, REPLAY, WRONG_CHAIN, UNAVAILABLE, INTEGRITY_FAILURE), retry/cancel/reconcile operations and no secret-bearing diagnostics. Public chain, external RPC, wallets and peer relays are independently untrusted; distinguish observed data from cryptographically verified facts. Require fail-closed handling of unsupported versions and security downgrades. Preserve keyboard/screen-reader access and translated error/help text.

## Threat model and tests
Stale offers, metadata triangulation, fake liquidity, Sybil spam, malicious filtering, expiry races and invite leaks.

Acceptance: unit and negative tests for all failure classes; fuzz parsers or financial invariants; test restart/reorg/timeout where relevant; browser mobile compatibility; signed deployment manifest; documented residual privacy risks; dependency version/license lock; independent security review before real funds.
