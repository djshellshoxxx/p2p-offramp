# Payment-proof replay prevention

**Status:** Expanded design specification; independent security review and implementation pending. **Priority:** advanced feature unless MVP evidence policy. **Normative:** MUST is a release gate; SHOULD needs an approved deviation.

## Purpose, scope and trust model
A proof MUST bind a random challenge (>=128 bits), protocol version, chain ID, escrow contract, trade ID, currency, amount in minor units, beneficiary commitment, payment reference and proof verifier version. A consumed proof/nullifier is stored in authoritative verifier state; browser localStorage alone cannot prevent replay. Define domain-separated nullifier derivation, expiry, finality/reorg rollback and cross-chain rejection. A bank receipt can be authentic and still reversible.

## Interfaces and implementation requirements
Define versioned input/output types, canonical serialization, required/optional fields, explicit validation and typed errors. Authenticate trust roots and user consent at boundaries. Use pinned audited dependencies and recorded test vectors; prohibit silent fallback to weaker proof, cipher, transport or verifier. Document privacy metadata exposed to chain, relay, issuer and browser. Reject unsupported versions, oversized inputs, expired assertions and mismatched trade/chain context. State machine MUST have terminal failure and cancellation paths and user-safe recovery. Avoid putting credentials, identity secrets or evidence plaintext in URLs, logs or public chain events.

## Security tests and acceptance
Tests: same proof twice, two trades, two chains, alternate relays, old verifier key, colliding references, modified recipient, late proof, chain reorg, concurrent submit. Never release escrow automatically from a proof in MVP.

Add unit tests, negative/fuzz tests for parsers and cryptographic inputs, integration fixtures, browser recovery and replay tests. Verify independent implementation against published vectors before any live-fund deployment. Record known limitations, dependency lock, verifier key hashes and reviewer sign-off.

Exact algorithms and key management choices remain gated architectural decisions.
