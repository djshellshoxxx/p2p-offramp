# Proof job resource and cancellation budget

**Status:** Expanded design specification; independent security review and implementation pending. **Priority:** advanced feature unless MVP evidence policy. **Normative:** MUST is a release gate; SHOULD needs an approved deviation.

## Purpose, scope and trust model
Proof generation runs in an isolated worker with hard configurable limits on memory, CPU, wall-clock time, payload length, concurrency and temporary storage. Benchmark limits separately on low-memory Android, iOS Safari and desktop; do not hardcode unmeasured device promises. One proof job per trade; explicit user consent and cancel; clean worker state on abort as best effort. Keep sensitive witness and bank session material out of logs and persisted job queues.

## Interfaces and implementation requirements
Define versioned input/output types, canonical serialization, required/optional fields, explicit validation and typed errors. Authenticate trust roots and user consent at boundaries. Use pinned audited dependencies and recorded test vectors; prohibit silent fallback to weaker proof, cipher, transport or verifier. Document privacy metadata exposed to chain, relay, issuer and browser. Reject unsupported versions, oversized inputs, expired assertions and mismatched trade/chain context. State machine MUST have terminal failure and cancellation paths and user-safe recovery. Avoid putting credentials, identity secrets or evidence plaintext in URLs, logs or public chain events.

## Security tests and acceptance
Tests: oversized witness, concurrent start, tab suspension, browser eviction, worker crash, low storage, cancellation mid-proving, repeated retry, memory pressure and device overheating. Provide progress and safe retry without silently resubmitting transactions.

Add unit tests, negative/fuzz tests for parsers and cryptographic inputs, integration fixtures, browser recovery and replay tests. Verify independent implementation against published vectors before any live-fund deployment. Record known limitations, dependency lock, verifier key hashes and reviewer sign-off.

Exact algorithms and key management choices remain gated architectural decisions.
