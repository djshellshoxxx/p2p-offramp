# Application message envelope

## 1. Metadata

- **Specification ID:** PRIV-APPLICATION-MESSAGE-ENVELOPE
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Owner:** p2p-offramp maintainers
- **Status:** Expanded design baseline — implementation and independent review pending
- **Section:** 05_ADVANCED_PRIVACY_INFRASTRUCTURE
- **Feature:** feature_5.3_encrypted_messaging
- **Module:** module_5.3.1_message_adapters
- **Delivery:** Core messaging/policy/display where consumed by Phase 2; other privacy extensions are opt-in Phase 3 or later, subject to the roadmap.
- **Normative language:** MUST is a release gate; SHOULD deviations require a recorded reason.

## 2. Objective and boundary

Define authenticated messages bound to participants, trades, and versions. Specify sequence, expiry, and replay fields independent of messaging providers.

The system authority contract governs this module: external wallets authorize spending; deployed escrow and reconciled chain observations establish custody state; relay and local data are untrusted claims. This specification creates no operator release path, automatic bank payment or authority over an already funded trade. Missing optional infrastructure MUST preserve basic release/refund and encrypted recovery paths.

## 3. Architecture and data contracts

Private application payload v1 has format p2p-offramp-message, version 1, trade binding, termsHash (64 lowercase hex), messageId (16 random bytes lowercase hex), sender identity, recipient identity, kind (text/terms/receipt-status), createdAt (safe integer milliseconds) and body. Text is at most 16384 UTF-8 bytes, whole payload at most 24576 bytes; protocol limits may be smaller.

Runtime validation MUST reject unknown versions/properties, unsafe integers, duplicate identities and oversized inputs before expensive work. Network, deployment, trade and account generation are explicit bindings where economic state is involved. Amounts are unsigned decimal base-unit strings, never floating point. Immutable results and defensive copies prevent consumers mutating validated state. Protocol-specific limits override broader application limits.

## 4. Algorithms, transitions and invariants

Validate exact keys/types and recipient/trade/terms binding after authenticated protocol decryption. Route only supported kinds to their validator; unknown kinds are rejected, not rendered as HTML. Deduplicate on authenticated sender plus messageId within the encrypted history. A sender timestamp is untrusted ordering information; keep receipt order separately. Delivery acknowledgement is not fiat proof.

Asynchronous jobs carry a generation and AbortSignal. Revoked generations MUST NOT publish late plaintext, restore stale coverage or initiate new economic work. Dispose removes subscriptions and closes owned resources. Cancellation after broadcast is an uncertain transaction outcome requiring journal reconciliation, not proof of rollback. Existing signed/funded terms cannot be renegotiated by changing a local preference.

## 5. Interfaces, errors and recovery

encodeMessage(validatedPayload) produces deterministic UTF-8 JSON with documented schema field order; decodeMessage(bytes, expectedBinding) returns validated payload or fixed error. Persist only authenticated payload in G02 chat records. Transport envelopes remain protocol-specific.

All interfaces return the shared core result/error contract. Distinguish INVALID_INPUT, UNSUPPORTED_VERSION, UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER, UNAUTHORIZED, LOCKED, CANCELLED and unavailable external service; map concrete errors to registered G13 codes without exposing private content. No unbounded retry, secret-bearing diagnostics, destructive reset or silent downgrade is permitted. Operations that propose economic effects pass core preflight, durable G12 reservation and fresh external-wallet consent; this module cannot bypass them.

## 6. Threat assessment and privacy limits

Encryption does not authorize sender claims, escrow transitions or external links. Limit parser size before decode; render text inertly through G04. Message IDs prevent duplicate UI effects, not global replay across unbound contexts.

Active origin compromise, malicious extensions and a compromised OS can read unlocked state; capability wrappers are not a same-origin JavaScript sandbox. Transport encryption, payload encryption and chain privacy are independent properties. G02 remains the exact v1 storage authority: no alternative KDF, AAD, record kind or session token is introduced here. G03 alone governs authenticated fresh-key restore. No physical erasure, global anonymity or provider availability guarantee is made.

## 7. Verification, references and release gates

Test wrong recipient/trade/hash, duplicate IDs with changed content, invalid UTF-8, unknown fields/kinds, overlong text, markup and out-of-order delivery. No message may trigger a wallet operation.

For each supported profile record source/dependency commit, integrity digest, protocol revision, deployment/network IDs, fixture provenance, browser/provider matrix and named review. Mutable documentation links below identify primary protocols; they are not an evaluated implementation pin. Where no concrete profile is approved the implementation MUST return unsupported, not emulate success. Unit fixtures alone do not establish browser routing, wallet support or custody safety.

Acceptance requires positive interoperability and negative boundary cases, cancellation/reload fault injection, redacted logging checks, and a core-only build with advanced packages absent completing basic trading recovery. Record actual results separately; this expanded design is not test evidence. Independent review and applicable roadmap milestone gates remain pending.
