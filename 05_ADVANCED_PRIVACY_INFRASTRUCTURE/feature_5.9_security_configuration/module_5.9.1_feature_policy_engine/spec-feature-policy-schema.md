# Feature policy schema

## 1. Metadata

- **Specification ID:** PRIV-FEATURE-POLICY-SCHEMA
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Owner:** p2p-offramp maintainers
- **Status:** Expanded design baseline — implementation and independent review pending
- **Section:** 05_ADVANCED_PRIVACY_INFRASTRUCTURE
- **Feature:** feature_5.9_security_configuration
- **Module:** module_5.9.1_feature_policy_engine
- **Delivery:** Core messaging/policy/display where consumed by Phase 2; other privacy extensions are opt-in Phase 3 or later, subject to the roadmap.
- **Normative language:** MUST is a release gate; SHOULD deviations require a recorded reason.

## 2. Objective and boundary

Define required, optional, unsupported, and conflicting capabilities. Specify validation that preserves mandatory custody and authorization invariants.

The system authority contract governs this module: external wallets authorize spending; deployed escrow and reconciled chain observations establish custody state; relay and local data are untrusted claims. This specification creates no operator release path, automatic bank payment or authority over an already funded trade. Missing optional infrastructure MUST preserve basic release/refund and encrypted recovery paths.

## 3. Architecture and data contracts

Policy v1 contains policyId (1..64 lowercase ASCII), revision (safe nonnegative integer), required capabilities (max 32), optional capabilities (max 32), disabled capabilities (max 32), transport mode and profile IDs. Capabilities are exact registered names/version/schema hashes; duplicates and contradictory sets are invalid.

Runtime validation MUST reject unknown versions/properties, unsafe integers, duplicate identities and oversized inputs before expensive work. Network, deployment, trade and account generation are explicit bindings where economic state is involved. Amounts are unsigned decimal base-unit strings, never floating point. Immutable results and defensive copies prevent consumers mutating validated state. Protocol-specific limits override broader application limits.

## 4. Algorithms, transitions and invariants

Validate exact fields and supported versions before evaluation. Intersect requirements with evaluated build/provider capabilities and explicit conflicts; unavailable required capability blocks only dependent new operations. Core invariants (wallet consent, custody guards, encrypted storage and terms binding) cannot be configured away. Policies propose features, not change deployed settlement authority.

Asynchronous jobs carry a generation and AbortSignal. Revoked generations MUST NOT publish late plaintext, restore stale coverage or initiate new economic work. Dispose removes subscriptions and closes owned resources. Cancellation after broadcast is an uncertain transaction outcome requiring journal reconciliation, not proof of rollback. Existing signed/funded terms cannot be renegotiated by changing a local preference.

## 5. Interfaces, errors and recovery

parsePolicy(bytes <= 32768), evaluatePolicy(policy, capabilitySnapshot), diffPolicy(old,new) and activatePolicy(validated) return immutable snapshots or fixed errors. Imported policy URLs cannot load executable code or new endpoints.

All interfaces return the shared core result/error contract. Distinguish INVALID_INPUT, UNSUPPORTED_VERSION, UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER, UNAUTHORIZED, LOCKED, CANCELLED and unavailable external service; map concrete errors to registered G13 codes without exposing private content. No unbounded retry, secret-bearing diagnostics, destructive reset or silent downgrade is permitted. Operations that propose economic effects pass core preflight, durable G12 reservation and fresh external-wallet consent; this module cannot bypass them.

## 6. Threat assessment and privacy limits

Policy injection can falsely display protection or enable remote providers. Authenticate release defaults; treat user imports as untrusted proposals requiring review. A checked box is not evidence of enforcement.

Active origin compromise, malicious extensions and a compromised OS can read unlocked state; capability wrappers are not a same-origin JavaScript sandbox. Transport encryption, payload encryption and chain privacy are independent properties. G02 remains the exact v1 storage authority: no alternative KDF, AAD, record kind or session token is introduced here. G03 alone governs authenticated fresh-key restore. No physical erasure, global anonymity or provider availability guarantee is made.

## 7. Verification, references and release gates

Fuzz unknown fields, duplicate names, oversize sets, unsupported hashes and conflicts. Test disabled core invariant rejection and core-only behavior with all optional capabilities absent.

For each supported profile record source/dependency commit, integrity digest, protocol revision, deployment/network IDs, fixture provenance, browser/provider matrix and named review. Mutable documentation links below identify primary protocols; they are not an evaluated implementation pin. Where no concrete profile is approved the implementation MUST return unsupported, not emulate success. Unit fixtures alone do not establish browser routing, wallet support or custody safety.

Acceptance requires positive interoperability and negative boundary cases, cancellation/reload fault injection, redacted logging checks, and a core-only build with advanced packages absent completing basic trading recovery. Record actual results separately; this expanded design is not test evidence. Independent review and applicable roadmap milestone gates remain pending.
